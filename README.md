# Satellite_Image_Classification_using_Machine_Learning_Classifiers
In this project we are using  Google Earth Engine. The software uses a JavaScript API.
In this project, we use SENTINEL 2 satellite image to classify into various classes like water, agriculture, snow, forest, builtup and barren land.
Different machine learning classifiers are used to classify the imagery.
Then use one classifier which gives the best result according to accuracy assessment.
